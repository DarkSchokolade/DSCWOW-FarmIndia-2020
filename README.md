### Digitalization of farmer's market:
It is a portal for farmers to sell their yield at their own price or to the highest bidder

### Current scenario:
The government decides the price of the crops,
Hoarding of crops to increase the market price
All these affect the farmer by not getting the profit he is supposed to

### This is where our platform comes into place
With our portal the farmer can call his own price
Retailers bid for the crop 
This Reduces the interaction of middle man , hence profiting both the farmer and retailer
